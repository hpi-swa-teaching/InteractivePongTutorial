		'If you are unsure how to proceed or a stuck at a method there are some hints following.'.
		'Hint 1: You should set the new center of the player by adding a new point with 0 as x value and the input clamped to the game border as y value'.
		'Hint 2: You can clamp the y value by using: "input" min: "upper border" max: "lower border".'.}.
